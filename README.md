# How to run PERN Stack

## First
 ### Run the batch file
    This will install NodeJS and NPM to your machine if it isn't already installed.
     - NodeJS is used for server side backend
     - NPM is like Maven and Gradle, it is basically a dependency manager and run configurator.
 ### If you don't have Postgres installed!
        Install postgres with their launcher
        GO TO: System Properties > Advanced > Environment Vars > System Vars > PATH > Edit > Browse > Postgres BIN

## Second
 ### Clone the repository using either VSCode or IntelliJ

## Finally
 ### Open a new terminal and run "npm start"
     - This will configure the front and backend concurrently
     - This will configure the connection pool using Postgres
